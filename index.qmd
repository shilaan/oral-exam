Ambition is defined as a persistent and generalized striving for success, attainment, and accomplishment. We know from prior literature and our own work that there’s a strong link between ambition and leader emergence. Ambitious individuals obtain higher levels of education, they graduate with higher GPAs, they end up in more prestigious occupations, and they obtain higher rank as well as higher salaries. 

But are these individuals who are highly ambitious and leadership-prone also more effective in leadership roles?

To answer this question, we rely on three lines of reasoning. 

First, we know from the literature on self-awareness that individuals tend to struggle with making accurate self-assessments. It is generally hard to form accurate appraisals of our own leadership effectiveness. 

Second, we know from research on self-serving biases that individuals tend to have inflated self-perceptions. 

Third, leadership roles come with highly appealing rewards – for example, money, status, autonomy, and authority. And the allure of these incentives may lead individuals to engage in motivated reasoning, where ambitious individuals who are drawn to leadership roles for reasons unrelated to their effectiveness may inflate their self-perceptions to justify their high ambition. 

In other words, we expect that ambitious individuals are more likely to fall prone to motivated reasoning, which reduces self-awareness, inflates self-perceptions, and causes a gap between self-assessments and third party-assessments of their leadership effectiveness.

Based on this reasoning, we posit two hypotheses. Our first hypothesis is that there’s a positive relationship between ambition and self-rated leader effectiveness. Our second hypothesis is that there’s a null relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leadership effectiveness.

To test our hypotheses, we ran four studies.   

In Study 1A and 1B, we obtained 360-degree assessments of executives, who were rated by themselves, their peers, their direct reports, and their supervisors.   

In Study 2, we examined the relationship between the ambition of MBA students and their expert-rated effectiveness during a leadership skills competition.   

In Study 3, we randomly assigned participants from a nationally representative sample to a leader or a follower role in a group decision-making task, and examined the relationship between leader ambition and follower-rated effectiveness.

## Analytic Approach 

. . .

**Null Hypothesis**: No relationship between ambition and third-party ratings  

. . .

**Alternative Hypothesis**: A relationship between ambition and third-party ratings 

. . .

::: panel-tabset

## **Null Hypothesis Significance Tests**

- Can we reject the **null hypothesis**?
- *p* < .05: **Reject** the null hypothesis
  - Interpreted as evidence for the alternative
- *p* > .05 : **Inconclusive** 
  - "**Fail to reject**" the null
  - **Cannot** be used to accept the null
  
## **Statistical Equivalence Tests**

- Can we reject the presence of a **meaningful effect**?
- *p* < .05: **Reject** the presence of a meaningful effect
  - Conclude **statistical equivalence**
  - Declare **absence of a meaningful effect**
- *p* > .05: **Inconclusive**
  - "**Fail to reject**" the presence of a meaningful effect
  - **Cannot** be used to declare presence of a meaningful effect
  
## **Bayesian Statistics**

- Can we **accept** the null hypothesis? 
- **Bayes factors**: How much do the data **support** the null hypothesis?
- $BF_{0} > 1$: support for the **null** hypothesis over the alternative
  - **Accept** the null, **reject** the alternative
- $BF_{0} < 1$: support for the **alternative** hypothesis over the null
  - **Accept** the alternative, **reject** the null

::: {.notes}

A quick overview of our analytic approach. As you may recall, our second hypothesis is a null hypothesis---we propose that there is no relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leadership effectiveness.  

To assess the evidence for this hypothesis, we use a combination of three analytic techniques: null hypothesis significance tests, statistical equivalence tests, and Bayesian statistics.  

When running significance tests, the main question that we can answer is "can we reject the null hypothesis"? If we obtain a p-value less than .05, we reject the null hypothesis, which we often interpret as indirect evidence for the alternative. If we obtain a p value greater than .05, however, the result is inconclusive. We fail to reject the null, and cannot accept the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between ambition and third-party ratings.

Because the null hypothesis is core to our theorizing, we complement this traditional approach with two other tests. The first is a statistical equivalence test. When running an equivalence test, the main question that we can answer is "can we reject the presence of a meaningful effect"? When we obtain a p-value less than .05, we reject the presence of a meaningful effect and conclude statistical equivalence: this means that third-party ratings are equivalent regardless of a leader's level of ambition. In other words, we can declare that a meaningful effect is absent. 

Our third test relies on Bayesian statistics. Here, we can also answer the question "can we accept the null hypothesis"? To answer this question, we compute Bayes Factors, which express how much the data support the null hypothesis over the alternative. If the Bayes Factor in favor of the null is greater than 1, this means that the data are more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative, and you accept the null as a result.

Thanks for bearing with me -- Let’s take a look at Study 1A and 1B. Our participants were managers enrolled in a one-year leadership development program. As part of the curriculum, they completed a 360-degree assessment of their leadership effectiveness, which was completed by themselves as well as their managers, peers, and direct reports. We obtained this archive of leadership evaluations, and also sent out our own survey to each manager in which they self-reported their ambition.

For hypothesis 1, we predicted a positive relationship between ambition and self-ratings of leadership effectiveness. We ran mixed effects models predicting self-assessments from ambition, and find support for this hypothesis in both Study 1A and study 1B. 

For hypothesis 2, we predicted a null relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leadership effectiveness. We ran mixed effects models predicting third-party assessments from ambition, and we find a nonsignificant relationship in both Study 1A and study 1B. 

To be able to claim support for the null hypothesis, we ran two additional tests. First, we ran an equivalence test. This test allowed us to declare, in both studies, the absence of a meaningful relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leader effectiveness. Second, we calculated Bayes Factors, which allow us to quantify how much the data support the null hypothesis. We find that the data are 6 to 20 times as likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis.

## Uncalibrated Ambition

. . .

Ambitious individuals are judged as **no more effective** in leadership roles

- Executives rated by peers, subordinates, and managers in a 360-degree assessment 
- MBA students judged by experts in a leadership skills competition
- A nationally representative sample of U.S. adults leading a small team in a leadership task  

. . .

**However...**

- Ambitious individuals are more likely to **emerge** as leaders
- Ambitious individuals report **more positive views** of their leadership effectiveness
  
. . .

**Emergence-Effectiveness Gap** 

- Ambition is **uncalibrated** to actual effectiveness
- Ambitious individuals **over-emerge** as leaders

In conclusion, we find that ambitious individuals are judged as no more effective in leadership roles. This finding held for 360-degree assessments of current executives judged by their peers, direct reports, and supervisors; MBA students judged by experts in a leadership challenge; and a nationally representative sample of US adults leading a small team in leadership task. 

However, ambitious individuals are more likely to become leaders, and they also tend to hold more positive views of their leadership effectiveness. 

Putting these two findings together, we conclude that we have identified an emergence-effectiveness gap, where individuals are unable to calibrate their ambition to their actual effectiveness, and ambitious individuals tend to over-emerge as leaders as a result.

Now, why does this matter?

A pretty shocking estimate in the literature is that 50 to 75 percent of selected leaders fail. Even though groups have strong incentives to place the right person in charge, and they strive to do so, they often fail. Now, why do we so often fail? Our work suggests that, in part, the fault lies in the processes we use to select leaders. 

Leader selection mechanisms are often opt-in: individuals must actively choose to be considered for leadership roles. The underlying assumption is that those with the greatest leadership potential will apply. Across four studies, we show that this assumption may be unfounded. 

Rather than allowing ambitious individuals to dominate candidate pools for leadership roles, society may need an alternative approach to leadership development and selection. In the future, we hope to identify a systematic lever that can foster diversity in upper-level positions and promote workplace advancement for individuals with high leadership potential.

"Society tends to attribute **authority** to those who convey **certainty**  
rather than to those who emphasize **uncertainty**"

</center> 

<br></br>

. . . 

Past research outlines **two opposing positions**:

- Expressing uncertainty is **detrimental** to leaders' social influence
- Expressing uncertainty is **beneficial** to leaders' social influence

. . . 


How can we **reconcile** these two perspectives?

- Expressing **confidence** is effective across a wide range of social settings
  - Courtroom, military, political arena, hiring committees...
- **Advice**-giving
  - Confident advice is more likely to be followed, regardless of **accuracy**/**quality** 
  - Physicians, brokers, consultants, therapists, peer reviewers...
- **Presumption of calibration**
  - A person's expressed **confidence corresponds to their actual competence**

**Humble** leadership

- Showing “humanness”: admitting limitations and knowledge gaps

. . .


**Authentic** leadership

- Knowing and acting upon true values, beliefs, integrity, and strengths
- Involves self-awareness: authentic leaders are conscious of knowledge gaps

. . . 

**Vulnerability** and **self-disclosure**

- Disclosing personal limitations and weaknesses 

. . .

Positive outcomes of **humility**, **authenticity**, **vulnerability**, and **self-disclosure** include...

- Trust, liking, engagement, psychological safety, feedback seeking, knowledge and information sharing, job satisfaction, job and task performance, creativity, organizational citizenship behavior, job retention, team learning

- On a 9-point scale ranging from highly certain (-4) to highly uncertain (+4)  
- Three types of uncertainty expressions 
  - **Calibrated scale** ("On a 1-9 scale, where 1 = highly uncertain and 9 = highly certain, my certainty level is a 7")
  - **Percentages** ("I am 80% sure")
  - **Colloquial, qualitative statements** ("I am absolutely convinced")
- Relied on a **novel computational measure** of certainty in language: the Certainty Lexicon

## Experimental Design and Procedure{style='font-size: 23px'}

<br></br>

- Five designs to confirm **generalizability** across different experimental tasks 
- Prolific participants randomly assigned to one of five experimental **designs**
  - Within each design, randomly assigned to one of nine experimental **conditions**
  - 6,000 participants; 1,200 per design; $\pm$ 133 per condition
- Three-round **incentivized** game
- Paired with a **leader** who gives advice expressed in varying degrees of uncertainty
- Advice quality and accuracy held **constant**
- Measure attitudinal and behavioral **consequences** of leader-expressed uncertainty

**Message from Team Leader:**  
I said D here. I’ve been asked to quantify for you how certain I am that it’s the right answer. On a 1-9 scale (where 1 = highly uncertain and 9 = highly certain), I’d say my certainty level is a(n) [***1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9***].

I played 4. I am [***1/10/20/40/50/60/80/90/99***]% sure that's the best choice.

## Study 5: Prediction game

. . .


![](images/dogcat.jpeg){.absolute right="0" top="125" width="550"}


<br></br>



- Participants report their own **preferences**
- Participants **predict** preferences of 100 other survey-takers
- Goal is to guess **within 5 points** of correct answer

. . .

<br></br>

How many of 100 people surveyed prefer having a **cat** to a **dog**?


<br></br>

. . .


**Message from Team Leader:**  
I said 40 here. I’ve been asked to quantify for you how certain I am that it’s within 5 points of the right answer. On a 1-9 scale (where 1 = highly uncertain and 9 = highly certain), I’d say my certainty level is a(n) [***1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9***].

## Behavioral Outcomes

<!-- ![](images/influence.png){.absolute bottom="0" right="0" width="400"} -->

<br></br>

- Advice-following/performance<details>
    <summary>
    Show details
    </summary>
In each round, we obtain a dichotomous measure indicating whether participants choose the leader's recommended strategy (0 = no, 1 = yes). We sum the three separate indicators into a single measure of advice-following
    </details>
- Leader selection<details>
    <summary>
    Show details
    </summary>
At the end of 3 rounds, participants move on to a new incentivized game and are asked whether they would like to keep the same team leader or be paired with a new team leader (with similar performance). We obtain a single dichotomous measure indicating whether participants choose to keep the same leader (leader selection: 0 = no, 1 = yes)
    </details>
- Leader reward<details>
    <summary>
    Show details
    </summary>
Participants are asked how much, if anything, they would like to award the leader, on a bonus payment slider ranging from \$0 to \$5

## Self-Selection into Candidate Pools

![](images/Shutterstock_1643439796.jpg){.absolute bottom="25" right="0" height="400"}

<br></br>

- Leader selection mechanisms rely on a **strong default of self-selection**
- Individuals must actively "**opt-in**" to the candidate pool for leadership positions
- Despite the ubiquity of this default... 
- Unknown how it affects **composition** and **effectiveness**  
of candidate pools for leader roles

## Effectiveness implications{style='font-size: 23px'}

<br></br>

- Examine the **effectiveness** implications of **self-selection** into candidate pools for leadership roles
- Hypothesize that self-selection induces **adverse leader selection**, creating a candidate pool that is...
  - **Underrepresented** on attributes helpful to leadership effectiveness (e.g., prosociality)
  - **Overrepresented** on attributes harmful or unrelated to leadership effectiveness (e.g., ambition, overconfidence, narcissism)
- Compare **opt-in** vs. **opt-out** selection mechanisms
- Goal: identify institutional **interventions** that may... 
  - Foster **diversity** in upper-level positions 
  - Promote workplace **advancement** for individuals with strong leadership **potential**
  
## Hypotheses

**Opt-in** (vs **opt-out**) mechanisms...

<br></br>

. . .


H1: **Decrease** the aggregate **effectiveness** of candidate pools for leadership roles 

. . .

H1a: **Increase** the prominence of effectiveness-**inhibiting** traits in candidate pools

. . .

H1b: **Increase** the prominence of effectiveness-**irrelevant** traits in candidate pools

. . .

H1c: **Decrease** the prominence of effectiveness-**inducing** traits in candidate pools
