Ambition is defined as a persistent and generalized striving for success, attainment, and accomplishment. We know from prior literature and our own work that there’s a strong link between ambition and leader emergence. Ambitious individuals obtain higher levels of education, they graduate with higher GPAs, they end up in more prestigious occupations, and they obtain higher rank as well as higher salaries. 

But are these individuals who are highly ambitious and leadership-prone also more effective in leadership roles?

## Ambition ➙ Leader Effectiveness?{background-image="images/self-aware.png" background-size="520px" background-position="95% 30%"}

<br></br>

. . .

**Self-Perception and Self-Awareness**   

. . .

Individuals struggle to gauge, and report **uncalibrated** views of, their **effectiveness**

- The "**above-average**" & "**below-average**" effect

. . . 

**Allure of Incentives**  

. . .

Individuals may be **drawn** to leadership roles for reasons **unrelated to aptitude**

- **Material** & **psychological** rewards

. . . 

**Motivated Reasoning and Cognitive Consistency**  

- Influenced by incentives, individuals may **inflate** self-perceptions and vie for leadership roles **regardless of actual leadership potential and aptitude**

::: {.notes}

To answer this question, we rely on three lines of reasoning. 

First, research on self-perception and self-awareness, particularly as it relates to one’s own competence and skills, suggests that people struggle to gauge their own effectiveness and consistently report uncalibrated views of their competence. Individuals often regard themselves more positively than they deserve (the “above-average effect”)—and, in some cases, more negatively than they deserve (the “below-average effect”). So, even if people are motivated to form accurate appraisals of their own leadership effectiveness, it remains unclear whether they can.

Instead, ambitious individuals may be drawn to leadership roles for reasons that are unrelated to their aptitude. Senior leadership roles provide considerable benefits, leading individuals to strive for ever-higher rungs on the corporate ladder. Not only do these high-ranking positions promise more money, they often offer a sweep of other material benefits, such as generous 401(k) contributions, pension plans, and paid time off—all of which are highly desirable. Aside from such material incentives, leadership positions are also associated with psychological rewards, such as authority, freedom, social influence, and status.

Finally, the allure of these incentives, both material and psychological, may lead individuals to elevate their ambition beyond the limits of their aptitude (i.e., “people may be overly optimistic” and “realized outcomes may fall short of their ambition”). Decades of research on motivated reasoning, cognitive dissonance, and cognitive consistency suggest that ambitious individuals—influenced by the attractive rewards that come with leadership roles—may inflate their self-perceptions to align with their ambition. Put differently, ambition may reduce self-awareness, leading individuals to vie for leadership roles regardless of their actual leadership potential and aptitude. Ultimately, we expect these forces to reduce self-other agreement in leadership effectiveness ratings, by (1) strengthening the link between ambition and self-appraisals of leader effectiveness and (2) weakening the link between ambition and third-party appraisals of leader effectiveness.

## Is Ambition Well-Calibrated?

![](images/leader.png){.absolute right="320" bottom="0" height="325"}

. . .

<br></br>

**Positive Uncorroborated Self-views HYpothesis (PUSHY)**  

- Ambition is related to **positive self-views**...
- that remain **uncorroborated** by relevant third-party actors

. . .

*Ambition is calibrated to **self-perceptions**, but **not to third-party perceptions**, of leader effectiveness*



::: {.notes}

We answer a call for more research on the potential link between ambition and leader effectiveness by studying whether it is well-calibrated (i.e., whether more ambitious people are more effective leaders). We hypothesize that ambition is associated with uncorroborated positive self-views (the “Uncorroborated Positive Self-Views Hypothesis”): that is, ambition is calibrated to self-perceptions, but not to third-party perceptions, of leader effectiveness.

To test the Uncorroborated Positive Self-Views Hypothesis, we relied on 360-degree leadership assessments of a unique field sample of employed executives rated by peers, subordinates, managers, and themselves (N = 3,830 ratings of 472 executives). We combine a Response Surface Analysis with an information-theoretic approach to examine whether leader ambition is related to positive self-views that remain uncorroborated by relevant third-party actors.

## Uncalibrated Ambition

. . .

Ambitious individuals are judged as **no more effective** in leadership roles

- Executives rated by peers, subordinates, and managers in a 360-degree assessment 
- MBA students judged by experts in a leadership skills competition
- A nationally representative sample of U.S. adults leading a small team in a leadership task  

. . .

**However...**

- Ambitious individuals are more likely to **emerge** as leaders
- Ambitious individuals report **more positive views** of their leadership effectiveness
  
. . .

**Emergence-Effectiveness Gap** 

- Ambition is **uncalibrated** to actual effectiveness
- Ambitious individuals **over-emerge** as leaders

::: {.notes}
In conclusion, we find that ambitious individuals are judged as no more effective in leadership roles. This finding held for 360-degree assessments of current executives judged by their peers, direct reports, and supervisors; MBA students judged by experts in a leadership challenge; and a nationally representative sample of US adults leading a small team in leadership task. 

However, ambitious individuals are more likely to become leaders, and they also tend to hold more positive views of their leadership effectiveness. 

Putting these two findings together, we conclude that we have identified an emergence-effectiveness gap, where individuals are unable to calibrate their ambition to their actual effectiveness, and ambitious individuals tend to over-emerge as leaders as a result.

Now, why does this matter?

A pretty shocking estimate in the literature is that 50 to 75 percent of selected leaders fail. Even though groups have strong incentives to place the right person in charge, and they strive to do so, they often fail. Now, why do we so often fail? Our work suggests that, in part, the fault lies in the processes we use to select leaders. 

Leader selection mechanisms are often opt-in: individuals must actively choose to be considered for leadership roles. The underlying assumption is that those with the greatest leadership potential will apply. Across four studies, we show that this assumption may be unfounded. 

Rather than allowing ambitious individuals to dominate candidate pools for leadership roles, society may need an alternative approach to leadership development and selection. In the future, we hope to identify a systematic lever that can foster diversity in upper-level positions and promote workplace advancement for individuals with high leadership potential.

  - Within each design, randomly assigned to one of nine experimental **conditions**
  - 6,000 participants; 1,200 per design; $\pm$ 133 per condition
- Three-round **incentivized** game
- Paired with **leader** 
- **Advice** expressed in varying degrees of uncertainty
- Advice **quality** and **accuracy** held constant
- Measure attitudinal and behavioral **consequences** 


## Manipulating Uncertainty

<br></br>

- On a 9-point scale ranging from highly certain (-4) to highly uncertain (+4)  
- Three types of uncertainty expressions (one for each round)
  - **Calibrated statements** ("On a 1-9 scale, where 1 = highly uncertain and 9 = highly certain, my certainty level is a 7")
  - **Percentage statements** ("I am 80% sure")
  - **Colloquial, qualitative statements** ("I am absolutely convinced")
- Relied on a **novel computational measure** of certainty in language: the Certainty Lexicon

I picked Pride here. If I had to express my certainty in terms of a percentage, I’d say I am [***1/10/20/40/50/60/80/90/99***]% sure that I got this one right. 

## Study 5: Prediction game

<br></br>



- Participants report their own **preferences**
- Participants **predict** preferences of 100 other survey-takers
- Goal is to guess **within 5 points** of correct answer

. . .

<br></br>

How many of 100 people surveyed prefer having a **cat** to a **dog**?


<br></br>

. . .


**Message from Team Leader:**  
I said 40 here. I’ve been asked to quantify for you how certain I am that it’s within 5 points of the right answer. On a 1-9 scale (where 1 = highly uncertain and 9 = highly certain), I’d say my certainty level is a(n) [***1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9***].

::: {.notes}
To test our hypotheses, we ran four studies.   

In Study 1A and 1B, we obtained 360-degree assessments of executives, who were rated by themselves, their peers, their direct reports, and their supervisors.   

In Study 2, we examined the relationship between the ambition of MBA students and their expert-rated effectiveness during a leadership skills competition.   

In Study 3, we randomly assigned participants from a nationally representative sample to a leader or a follower role in a group decision-making task, and examined the relationship between leader ambition and follower-rated effectiveness.

::: {.notes}
For hypothesis 1, we predicted a positive relationship between ambition and self-ratings of leadership effectiveness. We ran mixed effects models predicting self-assessments from ambition, and find support for this hypothesis in both Study 1A and study 1B. 

For hypothesis 2, we predicted a null relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leadership effectiveness. We ran mixed effects models predicting third-party assessments from ambition, and we find a nonsignificant relationship in both Study 1A and study 1B. 

To be able to claim support for the null hypothesis, we ran two additional tests. First, we ran an equivalence test. This test allowed us to declare, in both studies, the absence of a meaningful relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leader effectiveness. Second, we calculated Bayes Factors, which allow us to quantify how much the data support the null hypothesis. We find that the data are 6 to 20 times as likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative hypothesis.

In Study 2, we relied on a leadership challenge run during the Stanford MBA program. During the challenge, expert judges, who were current executives across a range of industries, rated each individual competitor on their leadership effectiveness. 

In support of Hypothesis 2, we find a nonsignificant relationship between ambition and expert ratings of leadership effectiveness. We again run an equivalence test and find that there is no meaningful relationship between ambition and third-party ratings of leader effectiveness. We also computed Bayes Factors, and find that the data are over 3 times as likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative.
